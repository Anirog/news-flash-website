On the rear of the RX100 VII, there are six primary buttons and a dial with four directional buttons. After experimenting with various setups, you can customise some of these buttons to change settings quickly without having to go into the settings menu of the camera, I’ve fine tuned my custom keys to suit my shooting style. Here’s how I’ve set them up:

This setup allows me to quickly adapt to different shooting situations, whether I’m working with fast moving subjects or changing lighting environments. It makes the camera much more intuitive to use in dynamic shooting scenarios.
